# Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
# Basic Indexing:
# Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
# a. Retrieve the 5th character.
# b. Retrieve the second to last character.
# c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.s
text='abracadabra'
print(text[5])
print(text[-2])
print(text[4])



# Advanced Slicing:
# Given the string alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',
# a. Extract the letters 'hij'.
# b. Extract every second letter starting from 'a' to 'm'.
# c. Reverse the entire string using slicing.
text="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
substring=text.find("hij")
print(substring)
substring=text[7:10]
print(substring)

substring=text.find("m")
print(substring)
print(text[0:12:2])
print(text[::-1]) 


# Problem Set 2: Extracting Information
# From Descriptions:
# Extract the name of the famous personality from the quote "Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. - John F. Kennedy"
text="Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. - John F. Kennedy"
substring=text.find("John F. Kennedy")
print(substring)
substring=text[83:98]
print(substring)


# Manipulating Words:
# Given the string info = "Python is fun. Fun is good. Good is subjective.",
# a. Extract the word 'subjective' without knowing its exact position.
# b. Extract every third word.
# c. Reverse the positions of the words, but keep the characters in each word in the same order.
text= "Python is fun. Fun is good. Good is subjective."
substring=text.find("subjective")
print(substring)
substring=text[36:-1]
print(substring)

sentence= "Python is fun. Fun is good. Good is subjective."
split_sentence= sentence.split()
print(split_sentence)
new_sentence="fun good subjective"
print(new_sentence)

print(text[::-1])


# Problem Set 3: String Methods
# Upper & Lower:
# Convert the following text to lowercase: "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."
sentence2 = "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU."
print(sentence2.lower())


# String Joining and Splitting:
# Given the list motto = ["Make", "haste", "slowly."],
word_list= ["Make", "haste", "slowly."]
# a. Convert the list into a single string.
joined_list = " ".join(word_list)
print(joined_list)
sentence3 = "Make haste slowly"
split_sentence = sentence3.split()
print(split_sentence)
# b. Now, split the string at every occurrence of the letter 'a'.


# Replacing Words:
# Modify the sentence: "Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans."
sentence4 = "Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans."
# a. Replace "busy" with "distracted".
# b. Replace "plans" with "mistakes".
new_sentence = sentence4.replace("busy","distracted").replace("plans","mistakes")
print (new_sentence)

# Problem Set 4: String Properties and Advanced Operations
# Repetition:
# Concatenate the word "Iteration" 7 times.
iteration = "Iteration" * 7
print(iteration)

# Word Search:
# Check if the word "moonlight" appears in the quote: "With freedom, books, flowers, and the moon, who could not be happy? - Oscar Wilde"
text = "With freedom, books, flowers, and the moon, who could not be happy? - Oscar Wilde" 
print(text.find("moonlight"))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
# Length and Count:
# a. Calculate the number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in the word/phrase: "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
text = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
print (len(text))
# b. Count the number of times the letter 'i' appears in the same word/phrase.
